The course places an emphasis on design based on the measurement of performance and its dependency on parallelism, efficiency, latency and resource utilization.

Intended to give students experience with tools and techniques of real-time programming, this course includes not only issues of microcomputer architecture and a real-time programming language and operating system, but also hands-on experience programming a microcomputer for applications such as process control, data acquisition and communication.

An introduction to distributed systems, emphasizing the multiple levels of software in such systems. Specific topics include fundamentals of data communications, network architecture and protocols, local-area networks, concurrency control in distributed systems, recovery in distributed systems, and clock synchronization.

An introduction to network architectures and protocols, placing emphasis on protocols used in the Internet. Specific topics include application layer protocols, network programming, transport protocols, routing, multicast, data link layer issues, multimedia networking, network security, and network management.

Basic techniques of system performance evaluation. Specific topics include: performance modeling, discrete event simulation, verification and validation of simulation models, analysis of simulation output, analysis of single server queue and queueing networks, modeling of computer systems, networks, and other queueing or non-queueing systems.</textarea>
