<p>Every device on the Internet is assigned an <a href="/wiki/IP_address" title="IP address">IP address</a> for identification and location definition. With the rapid growth of the Internet after commercialization in the 1990s, it became evident that far more addresses than the IPv4 address space has available were necessary to connect new devices in the future. By 1998, the <a href="/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force" title="Internet Engineering Task Force">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (IETF) had formalized the successor protocol. IPv6 uses a 128-bit address, allowing 2<sup>128</sup>, or approximately <span class="nowrap"><span style="display:none" class="sortkey">7038340000000000000♠</span>3.4<span style="margin-left:0.25em;margin-right:0.15em">×</span>10<sup>38</sup></span> addresses, or more than <span class="nowrap"><span style="display:none" class="sortkey">7028790000000000000♠</span>7.9<span style="margin-left:0.25em;margin-right:0.15em">×</span>10<sup>28</sup></span> times as many as IPv4, which uses 32-bit addresses and provides approximately 4.3 billion addresses. The two protocols are not designed to be <a href="/wiki/Interoperable" title="Interoperable" class="mw-redirect">interoperable</a>, complicating the transition to IPv6. However, several <a href="/wiki/IPv6_transition_mechanisms" title="IPv6 transition mechanisms" class="mw-redirect">IPv6 transition mechanisms</a> have been devised to permit communication between IPv4 and IPv6 hosts.</p>
<p>IPv6 provides other technical benefits in addition to a larger addressing space. In particular, it permits hierarchical address allocation methods that facilitate route aggregation across the Internet, and thus limit the expansion of routing tables. The use of multicast addressing is expanded and simplified, and provides additional optimization for the delivery of services. Device mobility, security, and configuration aspects have been considered in the design of the protocol.</p>
<p>IPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four <a href="/wiki/Hexadecimal" title="Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> digits with the groups being separated by colons, for example 2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334, but methods to abbreviate this full notation exist.</p></textarea>
